- Additional_data (folder)                Contains additional data used for the thesis:
                                          - 'Chemical_Final.xlsx' are the results of Zr concentration
                                          and majors analyses on bedrock samples (for zircon fertility);
                                          - 'rockeval_gornergletscher_2020.xlsx' are Total Organic
                                          Carbon (TOC) concentrations analyses;
                                          - 'Sample_list_and_lithology.xlsx' contains information
                                          on bedrock, sand and water samples used for the thesis (such
                                          as weight, number of extracted zircons, interpretation of
                                          bedrock geologies etc.;

                                          are the results of turbidity measurements on the Gornera
                                          river (data: Günther Pracisek);
                                          - 'Discharge.mat'/'Precipitation.mat'/'Temperature.mat' are
                                          for the Gornergletscher area and Gornera river during the
                                          study period (summer 2019).
