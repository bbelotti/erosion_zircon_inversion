GORNER SAMPLES AND RESPECTIVE LASER ABLATION identifiers (IDs). BRUNO BELOTTI, UNIL 2021.
SUMMARY OF ABLATION SPOT IDs (FROM LA-ICPMS RESULTS) AND THEIR ORIGINAL SAMPLES.

See Bruno Belotti's master's thesis (UNIL-2021) for further info about sampling sites and strategies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All samples come from the Gornergletscher area, VS, Switzerland:
GR = bedrock samples (are thought to comprehensively represent subglacial geology);
GS = deposited sediment samples (detrital from riverbanks);
GW = suspended sediment samples (detrital from water);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laser ablation results are datasets where each ablation spot has a unique ID.
These IDs are under the form 'jn13a05' where:
jn = month;
13 = day;
a  = ablation series (each series usually contains 10 ablation spots and 10 standards);
05 = ablation spot # (numbers 05-14 of each series).

All ablations were carried out during 4 days: Jan 13, Jan 14, Mar 04, Mar 11.
Note that, in cathodoluminescence images, grains with ablation spots (red circles) which are not
matched with an ID were NOT ablated (often because the grain was ripped off from the epoxy mount
during carbon uncoating).
Each grain's unique identifier is: 'SAMPLE ID + ICPMS NAME' --> some grains have >1 spot! (but
only for bedrock samples from days jn13 and jn14).
